SETUP
Create a new local and remote repo called 'secrets'.
Inside this repo, create 2 files 'encoder.rb' and 'decoder.rb'
 
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
In encoder.rb create a program that will take a string and apply methods from the String class to it to make the original meaning of the string difficult to discern.
 
In decoder.rb create a program that will take that mutated string from encoder.rb and will return it to its original configuration, making the meaning of the string clear again.
 
Post your links. If you worked in a team, you still must post a link.
